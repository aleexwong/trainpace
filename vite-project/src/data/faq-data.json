          "answer": "We sum the positive differences between elevation points — only counting uphill sections. Small noise or GPS spikes are filtered out to avoid inflating your stats.",

          "id": "duplicate-uploads",
          "question": "How do you handle duplicate uploads?",
          "answer": "We check for duplicate GPX files using file hashes. If you upload the same file twice, you'll get a warning, and it won't be counted twice in your saved files.",
