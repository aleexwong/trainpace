          "id": "elevation-calculation",
          "question": "How is elevation gain calculated?",
          "answer": "TrainPace uses a cumulative positive gain method — summing only uphill sections while filtering out GPS noise and small fluctuations. This provides clean, accurate elevation statistics. The API applies intelligent smoothing to handle barometric vs. GPS elevation data variations.",

          "question": "Why might elevation differ from Strava or Garmin?",
          "answer": "Different platforms use different smoothing algorithms, data sources (GPS vs. barometric altimeter), and correction methods. TrainPace prioritizes clarity and reproducibility with a transparent calculation approach. Small differences (5-10%) are normal and don't impact training insights significantly.",

          "question": "Do I need to fuel for a 10K race?",
          "answer": "For most 10K races, fueling is optional. If your finish time is under 45 minutes, your glycogen stores are typically sufficient. For slower 10K runners (over ~50 minutes), one gel may help maintain energy, but it's not required. TrainPace reflects this by recommending either 0 or 1 gel depending on your estimated time.",

        {
          "id": "marathon-fueling-strategy",
          "question": "How much should I fuel for a marathon?",
          "answer": "TrainPace recommends up to 1.5 gels per hour for half and full marathons, with a maximum of 7 gels total for full marathons. This aligns with ~30-60g of carbs per hour, preventing both under-fueling (bonking) and over-fueling (GI distress). The calculator balances energy needs with digestive tolerance based on race duration.",

          "id": "personalized-fueling",
          "question": "Why does weight matter for fueling?",
          "answer": "Entering your body weight allows TrainPace to calculate more personalized carbohydrate recommendations (approximately 0.7g per kg per hour). Heavier runners may need slightly more fuel, while lighter runners may need less. Weight input is optional — the calculator provides solid defaults if you skip it.",

          "question": "How does route analysis caching improve performance?",
          "answer": "TrainPace implements intelligent caching for elevation analysis. Static route data (elevation profile, distances) is stored once. When you adjust analysis parameters (base pace, grade thresholds), only lightweight calculations are re-run using cached data — no need to reprocess the entire GPX file. This makes parameter changes near-instant and saves API costs.",
